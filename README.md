# Card Shuffle

Card Shuffle is an application that takes a deck of 52 cards and shuffles them on button click. The user can toggle between two card displays:
1) Spread out - cards start face up and the user can click on a card to flip it over.
2) Pile - cards are face down in a pile. The user can click on the top card to flip it over and then have access to the next card in the pile.
